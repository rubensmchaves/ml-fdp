# Dataset for Financial Distress Prediction in an Imbalanced Data Stream Environment

Financial distress identification is crucial for companies, investors, and authorities. This dataset provides real-world indicators of Brazilian enterprises based on data from the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM), organized quarterly in a non-stationary manner. The dataset covers 10 years (2011 to 2020) and includes 905 different corporations and 23,834 records, each described with 84 indicators. The majority of the enterprises show no financial difficulties, while only 651 experienced financial distress. The data is strongly unbalanced: 2.73\% are data of companies in financial distress situation, while 97.27\% are not.

When a enterprise is identified in a financial distress situation we label it as 1. Otherwise the enterprise is considered in normal operation (0), see column LABEL. Due to the enterprise's business area, there is no accounting information in the CVM's data files. In this case, the accounting information value is set to zero. For example, a bank balance sheet has no inventory information, so it is zero. Thus, dataset has no missing values or synthetic and imputed added values.
