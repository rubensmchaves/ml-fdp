# Nonstationary and Imbalanced Dataset for Financial Distress Prediction

Identifying financial distress is critical for companies, investors, and regulatory authorities. The dataset used in this study provides real-world indicators of Brazilian enterprises, based on quarterly data from the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM), and is characterized by nonstationarity. It spans over 10 years and includes 84 financial indicators. The data is highly imbalanced: around 3% of the records correspond to companies in financial distress, while the remaining 97% represent non-distressed firms.

When a enterprise is identified in a financial distress situation we label it as 1. Otherwise the enterprise is considered in normal operation (0), see column LABEL. Due to the enterprise's business area, there is no accounting information in the CVM's data files. In this case, the accounting information value is set to zero. For example, a bank balance sheet has no inventory information, so it is zero. Thus, dataset has no missing values or synthetic and imputed added values.
